## 4. Few shot image synthesis with Top-K
- Train GAN using Python Notebook in "./projected-gan-topk/notebooks/My_projected_GAN.ipynb"
- (Code partially adapted from paper "Projected GANs Converge Faster" and the paper "Emergence of Shape Bias in Convolutional Neural Networks through Activation Sparsity")
- Trained in Google Colab using L4 GPU, for 100kimg, taking under 2 hours
- Requires loading data from "https://github.com/Crazy-Jack/nips2023_shape_vs_texture/tree/main/few-shot-img-syn/data"
